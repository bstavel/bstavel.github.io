**about**

I am a clinical neuroscientist with eight years of experience researching the causes and treatments of mood disorders. In this work, I take an interdisciplinary approach. While my PhD focused on the neural circuitry underlying anxiety, I also specialized in clinical psychology, where I got to work hands-on with clients giving evidence-based treatments. While my predoctoral work included machine learning and graph theory analyses to predict treatment outcomes, I also completed an internship at RAND where I worked on translational and policy issues related to suicide prevention. 

Fundamentally, I think mood disorders are caused by interlocking problems at the biological, psychological, interpersonal, societal & environmental levels. And we want to accelerate our ability to better understand, treat, and prevent mood disorders, we will need to bring multiple perspectives together across these levels.   

**research**

My research career began with large-scale treatment prediction studies to better match depressed/anxious individuals with unique SSRIs and behavioral interventions. In my doctoral work, I fit computational models of anxious decision-making and then use these models to better characterize the underlying brain circuitry.
